This program was used to automatize the mumax job submit in Holland Computing Center @UNL. This program creates the 
number of mumax3 script file and corresponding job submit files with different magnetic field. The out put file 
directories for different magnetic field in HCC working directory is also specified. Once all the the 
job_submit_script.py file is run it creates all such directories and submit the created mumax3 script files through 
the job submit files.

The plot program collects the output of all the pre-specified output directories and collect the relevant data to 
plot the average domain wall velocity vs magnetic field to see domain wall pinning-depinning transition.


NOTE: The parameters in the mumax3 script file can be modified to use for different purposes.
