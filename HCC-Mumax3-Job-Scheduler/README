A job scheduler to submit GPU, mumax3, simulations of ferromagnetic spin systems into HPC. 
This program creates a number of mumax3 script file and corresponding job submit files with different magnetic field within the range of fields given as inputs. The out put file 
directories for different magnetic field in HPC working directory is also specified. Once all the the job_submit_script.py file is run it creates all such directories and submit 
the created mumax3 script files through the job submit files.

The plot function collects the output of all the pre-specified output directories and collect the relevant data to 
plot the average domain wall velocity vs magnetic field to see domain wall pinning-depinning transition.

NOTE: The parameters in the mumax3 script file can be modified to use for different purposes.
